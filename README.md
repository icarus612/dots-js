## Collaboration

While this repository is just a personal project and not really set up for collaboration, I'm definitely open to it if you're interested. However, if you're looking to contribute to my active open source projects, I'd recommend visiting [The Icarus Project](https://github.com/the-icarus-project). That's where you'll find projects specifically designed for collaboration, complete with all the details and guidelines you need to get started. If you are still undeterred and wish to contribute please make a PR detailing the bug or feature, and I'll get to it as soon as I can.
