# Neural Networks

Hello there! 👋 I'm dev.icarus, a full-stack developer with a passion for building scalable and efficient applications. This repository serves as a gateway to my diverse range of projects. Here's how you can explore them:

## My Projects

Each of my projects has its own dedicated repository. You can browse them by visiting my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/icarus612). Here's what you can expect:

- **Project Overviews**: In each repository, you'll find a detailed README explaining the project's purpose, technology stack, and how to get it up and running.

- **Code Insights**: Dive into the code to see my coding style and the technologies I work with. Feel free to explore the commit history for a deeper understanding of the development process.

## Collaboration

While this repository is just a personal project and not really set up for collaboration, I'm definitely open to it if you're interested. However, if you're looking to contribute to my active open source projects, I'd recommend visiting [The Icarus Project](https://github.com/the-icarus-project). That's where you'll find projects specifically designed for collaboration, complete with all the details and guidelines you need to get started. If you are still undeterred and wish to contribute please make a PR detailing the bug or feature, and I'll get to it as soon as I can.
